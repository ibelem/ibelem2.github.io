[W3C Web Machine Learning Working Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/wg/webmachinelearning)
standardizes Web APIs for in-device machine learning inference working together
with the [W3C ecosystem](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Member/List)
using well-received Community Group incubations as its seeds. Its sister [Web
Machine Learning Community Group](https://www.w3.org/groups/cg/webmachinelearning)
incubates new proposals and is the placeÂ where new ideas are discussed and
explored before formal standardization.
